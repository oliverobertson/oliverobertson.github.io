                            <h2>Manifest Magic: How to Manifest Your Perfect Life</h2>
                    
                                <p>Do you find it hard to manifest the things you want into your life?

                                    Perhaps you follow the Law of Attraction and just can’t quite conquer manifestation? It can be tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, manifesting can become second nature to you..</p>

                                <p> Maybe you are unsure of what manifestation really means.

                                    Or maybe you need clarity on what the purpose of manifestation is!  In order to succeed in your manifestations, you need to truly believe in them.
                                    
                                    So, it’s worth knowing the ins and outs of what exactly manifestation is and how to properly manifest what you want.
                                    
                                    Before I share my manifestation guide with you, let’s take a look at what manifestation means and how it works.
                                    </p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="Alone.jpg" alt="man standing on a hill outside looking up at the sky at dusk">
                                    <figcaption>Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.</figcaption>
                                </figure>

                                <p>Like with the Law of Attraction, a manifestation is where your thoughts and your energy can create your reality. If you are constantly being negative and feeling down, then you are going to attract and manifest negative energy.

                                    The first thing to do when manifesting is to take a look at your thoughts and feelings. Are you feeling negative? Do your thoughts surround negativity?
                                    
                                    If so, you could begin to manifest things you don’t want in your reality. This is why it’s important to clear your mind and have a positive mind when you are wanting to manifest.
                                    
                                    Manifestation doesn’t just work with your thoughts, there has to be a form of action on your part. This could be actually applying for the jobs that suit what you are looking for and going to the interviews.
                                    
                                    Trying to visualize your thoughts and feelings about your job; will then help you to feel more positive and motivated to make these changes a reality. This will then push you to take some action and, ultimately, manifest your goals into your life.</p>

                                <p>When you decide on something specific to manifest, it’s vital that you know exactly why you want this specific thing in your life. And when you’re trying to manifest something in just 24 hours, you also have to pick something you believe you can manifest in a day.

                                    So, for example, there’s little point in saying you want to start a new business in 24 hours unless you actually believe you can attain this goal in the next day.
                                    
                                    However, you may well believe that you can successfully manifest the next step in your journey to a new business in a day, in which case you might set that as your goal (e.g. to complete a business plan, get a loan you need, or find someone to collaborate with).
                                    When picking a thing to manifest, ask yourself the following questions:
                                    
                                        Do I really want this, in my heart of hearts?
                                        How will I benefit from having this?
                                        When I think about having this, does it feel right?
                                        How will it be good for me and for others?
                                    
                                    Whatever want should be the greater good, and something you want in itself; most likely something that’s a significant step on the journey towards a greater manifestation goal.
                                    
                                    So, in sum: decide what you want, really connect with the intention to have it, and believe that you will receive what you ask for.</p>

                                    <img src="magic.jpg" alt="gold genie lamps on a table.">

                                </figure>
                    
                               <p> Unfortunately, almost always there will be something standing in your way to success. This shouldn't scare you, this is just part of the whole manifestation process.

                                Keep an eye out for these three most common manifestation blocks:
                                
                                    Negative core beliefs/mindset
                                
                                If you are in a bad place emotionally, you need to first get yourself into the right mindset before you can successfully manifest anything.
                                
                                You can't be focusing on negativity and expect to attract good things into your life. So take some time to practice self-care. Try meditation and different stress-relief techniques.
                                
                                    Toxic people
                                
                                When you are working on manifesting your dream you need to make sure no one is holding you back.
                                
                                People who don't believe in you, always criticize you, and/or complain about everything are blocks that will keep you from doing your best.
                                
                                    Timing
                                
                                Sometimes you just need to be patient. Everything you want will happen. but it will happen at the right time and for the right reasons.
                                
                                So if something isn't happening for you right now, it doesn't mean it never will. Keep believing and keep working on your goal.
                                
                                Sit back and think about how your manifestation process is going at the moment.
                                
                                Do you feel like you're on the right path or is something holding you back?</p>
